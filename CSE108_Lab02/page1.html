            <h2>What Types of Huskies are There?</h2>
        </header>
        <main>
            <p>Huskies quite literally come in many colors, however, before I get into the colors I must clarify a few things.</p>
            <p>There are two other dog species (off the top of my head) that look like huskies that can very easily be mis-identified as one.</p>
            <h3><p><b>Samoyed</b></p></h3>
            <p>First, there is the samoyed. A very fluffy (usually) white fur covered dog. </p>
            <img src="samoyed.webp" width = "300" height = "300">
            <br>
            <p>The fact that these dogs are similar in size with huskies (both breeds being medium sized) makes them even more easier to misidentify. 
                However, they are quite different. You can read more about them <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoyed_dog">here!</a>
            </p>
            <h3><p><b>Alaskian Malamute</b></p></h3>
            <p>These fluffy monsters are practically the same as huskies, except for their origin, and size. Alaskian malamutes classify as 
                large breed dogs and usually end up with more fur than huskies can have at their longest.

            <h3><p><b>The Main Information!</b></p></h3>
            <p>Now that I've cleared the easy misconceptions, let's begin with the promised information!</p>
            <p>For starters, huskies are relatively commonly found with <a href="https://www.aao.org/eye-health/diseases/what-is-heterochromia">heterochromia</a>
            or in other words, have 2 different eye iris colors. However, huskies <b>only</b> have two iris colors anyways. These two colors being light blue and brown.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Now for fur colors! Huskies can be found with these as their <b>main</b> colors. However, they can show traces of other colors on their bodies 
            on different small patches.</p>
